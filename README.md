# CS465-565-inclass-assignments

For exercises where we began recreating a webpage, I choose placekitten.
(For assignment 1 exercise 2 and assignment 2 exercise 2).

In assignment 3, I used CSS grid to design the layout#1 (exercise 3).
I used CSS Flexbox in layout#2 (exercise 4). For the remaining layouts I
used Bootstrap Grid.

In assignment 5 I created an Express server. I used ejs as a template renderer to
output the post data to the /submit webpage.

In assignment 6 I did the react, angular, and express tutorials. (my-app is the react tutorial).

Note: For exercises where asked to work on my portfolio are included in the portfolio folder. I did not create a
specific file for these exercises but due to the fact my portfolio was finished and turned in means those exercises where
completed.
