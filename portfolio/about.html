                <p> 
                    I am a student at Portland State University pursuing a bachelors
                    degree in Computer Science. As I am nearing the completion of my
                    degree I am begining efforts to find employment in the industry.

                    Starting my freshman year of college at Portland State University,
                    I began commuting to school by bike. At first I would simply ride
                    to public transportation, but as time went on I began biking the 
                    entire way. In total this is 38 miles of biking on days I commute 
                    to campus. In addition to biking I am also an avid runner, as I ran
                    for my highschool's cross country team. Though these activities may not
                    be the most fun, lets be honest, running sucks, the benefits they provide
                    are essential to me. The two benefits I value the most from these activities
                    are dicipline and mental clarity.

                    My biggest hobbie is certantly gaming. My favorite game 
                    League of Legends and World of Warcraft. As insane as it may sound,
                    there is a thriving and vast competitive seen for League of Legends.
                    As of 2017, Riot Games, the developer of League of Legends, claimed the game had 
                    100 million active players, and the 2018 World Championship was one of the most
                    watched events in histroy, reaching over 99 million unique viewers in total!
                    In 2016 I reached rank 512 on the North Amerrican ladder which is the top 0.03%
                    of all players in North America. This is an achievment I am very proud of and will
                    hold dearly for many years to come.
