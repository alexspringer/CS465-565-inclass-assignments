                    <h3> Education </h3>
                    <p> 
                        I am a student at Portland State University pursuing a bachelors
                        degree in Computer Science. During my studies,
                        I have been exposed to many programming languages through various
                        projects. Some of such languages are C, C++, C#, Python, html, css, and javascript.
                        I also have been given the chance to experience working in a large existing codebase
                        by improving upon the xv6 operating system, and experience in group projects through
                        a full-stack web application and a database of those seeking rehab from chocolate addictions.
                        Ultimately, as I am nearing the completion of my degree I am excited to apply everything
                        ive learned in university to real world experience.

                    <h3> Commitment to Health </h3>
                    <p> 
                        Starting my freshman year of college at Portland State University,
                        I began commuting to school by bike. At first I would simply ride
                        to public transportation, but as time went on I began biking the 
                        entire way. In total this is 38 miles of biking on days I commute 
                        to campus. In addition to biking I am also an avid runner, as I ran
                        for my highschool's cross country team. Though these activities may not
                        be the most fun, lets be honest, running sucks, the benefits they provide
                        are essential to me. Committing to commuting by bike shows dicipline, both
                        in sticking to a schedule and continuing on even as I get exhausted. Exercise
                        also helps me think better and more rationally, which I greatly value.

                    <h3> Hobbies </h3>
                    <p>
                        My biggest hobbie is certantly gaming. My favorite games are 
                        League of Legends and World of Warcraft. As insane as it may sound,
                        there is a thriving and vast competitive seen for League of Legends.
                        As of 2017, Riot Games, the developer of League of Legends, claimed the game had 
                        100 million active players, and the 2018 World Championship was one of the most
                        watched events in histroy, reaching over 99 million unique viewers in total!
                        In 2016 I reached rank 512 on the North Amerrican ladder which is the top 0.03%
                        of all players in North America. This is an achievment I am very proud of and will
                        hold dearly for many years to come. While not quite as competitive as League of Legends,
                        I have also achieved much in World of Warcraft. Currently I play in a top 500 North American
                        group and rank in the 93rd percentile of all players who play the same class as me. Ultimately,
                        it has been found that gamers have about a 20% higher problem solving iq then the rest of the
                        population, and being in the upper echalon of gamers, I would say problem solving is one of my
                        strengths.
